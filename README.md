# Quickstart 2e
Fantasy Grounds extension for Index Card RPG, supporting rules modifications in the quickstart 2e booklet.

This extension changes the core effort types, adding GUN effort as a d8 and moving MAGIC effort to the d10. The effects system supports a new effort type: "GUN"

## Compatibility
This extension is currently incompatible with the Altered State extension, as both extensions modify the base effort types. It is compatible with all other extensions, however.
